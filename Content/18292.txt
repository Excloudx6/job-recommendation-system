â â are you a senior full stack developer excited about the possibility of working on a small team to build cutting edge technology? do you have extensive experience with and understanding of distributed software application architecture?
at precisionhawk, weâre building technologies that change the way we view and interact with the world. our developers consistently push the boundaries of whatâs possible with drone technology,â and we pride ourselves on finding new ways to process data to solve real global problems.â 
how would you utilize your experience designing and developing software applications at precisionhawk? here are a few examples of what you can expect to do and learn:

build high-quality software components for precisionhawkâs platform
collaborate directly with project management, product, design, and engineering teams on new product features
help to build the technical processes, select the frameworks, and establish the design patterns that will drive our application's continued growth
assist with code reviews and provide feedback on code quality
develop documentation and design materials, as needed

you may expect to see a laundry list of requirements at this point. instead, we thought we would tell you a little bit about our tech stack and if you'd like to learn more, letâs be in touch.â 
the technology we use includes:

java, ruby on rails, javascript (es5 and es6), and python
mobile application development including android (java) and ios (swift) development
single-page application development with react and redux
amazon web services
gis applications (e.g. esri, arcgis, proj4j, postgis, grass, qgis)

if you are an experienced full stack developer who can quickly identify challenges, analyze the root causes, and propose solutions and tools to solve issues, apply today!â  together, weâll do things that have never been done!â
