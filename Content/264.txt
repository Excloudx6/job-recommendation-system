allen institute for cell science
the goal of the allen institute for cell science is to understand cell behaviors in their normal, pathological, and regenerative contexts. the institute, located in a new facility on south lake union in seattle, washington, will employ a multi-disciplinary team approach to generate novel cellular reagents, models, and databases. the institute aims to understand cells, individually and in collectives, as integrated systems of organelles and molecular machines that are regulated by signaling complexes, determining how they integrate to generate the plethora of observed cellular behaviors. it will do this using human induced pluripotent stem cells (hipsc), genome editing, a large live cell microscopy pipeline, predictive modeling and theory, and by creating a novel multi-scale, dynamic and visual output for the experiments and models.
position summary    
we are seeking a talented and enthusiastic individual to join the new allen institute for cell sciences microscopy and image processing pipeline team. the software developer will work under the guidance of a software engineer and scientists working with the image processing and data analysis pipeline and report to the director, microscopy & image processing pipeline.
