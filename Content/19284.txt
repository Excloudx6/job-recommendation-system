about gitcoin:
open source software delivers billions of dollars per year in economic value, but the developers themselves aren’t properly incentivized or compensated.   gitcoin is an incentivization power-tool for open source software repositories.   gitcoin pushes open source forward by enabling software developers to fund open source software with ether and ethereum-based tokens.  gitcoin is the first blockchain-enabled funding tool built by and for software developers.  for more information, please go to https://gitcoin.co.
