about the department
cloudflare’s engineering team builds and runs the software that handles about 10% of http requests on the internet today. we also build and run the internal tools that builds and runs our software. the engineering team is split into two groups: one handles product development and the other handles operations. product development covers both new features and functionality and scaling our existing software to meet the challenges of a massively growing customer base. the operations team handles one of the world’s largest networks with data centers in 102 cities worldwide.
responsibilities
we are looking for an experienced front-end developer to join our team. the ideal candidate will have experience with building large-scale javascript applications. you must care deeply about the quality of your and the team's code; its clarity, documentation and testing. we have a growing front-end team, so we’re looking for a highly motivated individual who can help drive the next generation of our web application and the associated development infrastructure.
we believe that a great design is at the heart of any successful product and you will work closely with our design/ux team and must be comfortable seeking feedback from non-technical sources. we work iteratively and deploy often (can be several times a day). we are in the midst of migrating our front-end application from backbone to react, maintain a suite of common components published on npm, and build/package with webpack. other technologies on our web application stack include sass (though moving towards component-based styling using fela), php & go (api layer), and postgres for data stores.

what makes us special
we’re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. we’re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. fundamental to our mission to help build a better internet is protecting the free and open internet. in 2014, we launched project galileo, an initiative through which we partner with global ngos to identify websites at risk of attack and provide the same state-of-the-art mitigation technology already used by cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost. project galileo equips politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work.
additionally, in 2016, we announced our partnership with path forward, a nonprofit organization that works with companies to create 18-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one. with the lofty goal of shaping the future of the internet, we’re focused on recruiting the best and the brightest, no matter what.
cloudflare is a security company. a successful background check is required for employment.
cloudflare hires the best people based on an evaluation of their abilities and effectiveness.  we don't discriminate against employees on the basis of any other personal characteristic or any classification protected by federal, state or local law.
