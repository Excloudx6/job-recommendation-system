trouble cutting and pasting your resume into the window provided





copy the resume from your text document (example: ms word) by opening/viewing the document and selecting edit - select all from the menu bar, then edit, copy.
go back to the enrollment page where you want to paste the resume.
click into the resume text box. you will see your curser blinking in the box.
go to the menu bar at the top of the browser and select edit, paste.  this will put the resume into the text area.
view what you have pasted and make sure it is visible within the limits of the box




 



resume doesn't look like it will fit within the text box provided




                            how your resume looks in the text box is not necessarily how it will look when an employer views it. be sure to align the bullets, tabs and spacing to ensure a well-formatted view for the recruiters.



 



using html when formatting your resume within the text box




                            do not use html when submitting your resume. your resume will be viewed by recruiters with widely varying screen dimensions, including palm pilots. your resume might be converted into straight ascii text and imported into a database or resume management software.



 



targeting your job search




you can fine tune your job search by using specific keywords in the keyword search. if these keywords are in any part of a job, the search will return those jobs.
                            
                            example keywords: marketing, business administration 
                            these words will result in job descriptions that include either marketing or business administration or both.
                            

                            example: business administration 
                            these words together result in job descriptions that include both words in the order you type them in.
                            

                            example: business administration and marketing and entry level 
                            these words result in job descriptions that include all of these words.
                            



 



selecting more than one choice in a list box




                            to select multiple choices in a drop down box, hold down the ctrl ("control") key while clicking the options with the mouse. use the shift key if you're using a macintosh.
                        


 



printing your resume




                            when you are reviewing your resume, click into that frame.  from your browser's menu, select 'file' and 'print - only selected frame.'
                        


 



changing your username and password




                            you will not be able to change your username or password.  if you lose your password, you can click on the "forgot password" button next to the password box on the login page.  if you have forgotten your username, you will need to register again.
                        


 



how your job spy work




                            routinely, your job spy will search the job database. if a new job has been added that contains your job spy criteria, that job will be emailed to you! enter the keywords that a job should contain in the "keyword(s)" box. create a memorable name for your job spy.
