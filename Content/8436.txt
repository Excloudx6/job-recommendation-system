about evelo
evelo biosciences is dedicated to improving the lives of patients globally through the development of a new modality of medicines – monoclonal microbials. monoclonal microbials are orally delivered medicines that modulate systemic immunology and biology through direct interactions with human cells in the gut. these new medicines are broadly applicable across many diseases – including autoimmune, immunoinflammatory, metabolic, neurological, neuroinflammatory diseases and cancer. monoclonal microbials have the potential to fundamentally change traditional models of drug discovery and development. by finding and selecting naturally occurring monoclonal microbials with defined therapeutic effects, evelo can improve the speed, cost and success of drug discovery and development. evelo’s platform enables pharmacological intervention at all stages of disease with naturally occurring, safe and effective monoclonal microbials. evelo biosciences was conceived and created within venturelabs®, flagship pioneering’s institutional innovation foundry, and launched by flagship in 2015. for more info
