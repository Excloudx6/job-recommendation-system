work area: software-development operations
expected travel: 0 - 10%
career status: professional
employment type: regular full time
company description
as market leader in enterprise application software, sap helps companies of all sizes and industries innovate through simplification. from the back office to the boardroom, warehouse to storefront, on premise to cloud, desktop to mobile device – sap empowers people and organizations to work together more efficiently and use business insight more effectively to stay ahead of the competition. sap applications and services enable customers to operate profitably, adapt continuously, and grow sustainably.
the concur data science team is looking for a bright and creative data scientist to help building new services within the company by leveraging the power of machine learning. the challenges range from document understanding and classification, nlp, recommendation services and building prediction services to matching and rank. we engage mainly with the expense team within the company and the team has a successful track record delivering real time services. we’re an end to end team and engage in all steps from idea, data exploration, model building and deployment
 
in the first 12 months, you will deliver:

machine learning services written in python and running in docker containers on premise and in the cloud. concur is embarking on a new project related to receipt audit, and is looking for a talented individual to design experiments and implement the service.
an understanding of the data sources available within concur, and contribute with ideas of how to turn these data sources into services that enhance the end user experience. some of your time will be spent digging into the expense reporting data streams to understand the data available and what the challenges are.
monitoring and reporting of your service: once you have your service in production you will want to know what’s going on! that usually means more data analysis and graphing and reporting so that you can understand/learn/improve in the next iteration. this also helps justify the investment.
new skills to the team: every few months you’ll have the opportunity to present an idea/algorithm or tool to the team and we have a small discussion about it and eat some cookies.  we love that each new team member brings additional skills and has past experience we can all learn from.

 
in order to accomplish this, you will need to:

have passion for data analysis! whether that’s a chart or a machine learning model writing in scikit-learn you love this stuff.
work with people throughout the company to understand how data is used and where we can best improve it.
build the necessary data features needed to support modeling.
use your data science background to build machine learning models.
continuously update your data science skills and progress.

 
so, who are we?
concur, an sap company, takes companies of all sizes beyond automation to a completely connected spend management solution encompassing travel, expense, invoice, compliance and risk. for more than 20 years, our global expertise and industry-leading innovation has kept customers a step ahead with time-saving tools, leading-edge technology and connected data.
 
your career at concur is what you make of it. you can forge your own path, work in different offices, switch business units or solve a problem that no one has before. we drive innovation forward until it becomes the new normal, but we’ll never accept business as usual if there’s an opportunity for business to be better. want to be a part of something amazing? check us out at: concur.com/careers
 
what do you need to bring?
 
we are looking for someone with the following qualifications:

master’s degree, or higher, in data science, statistics, computer science, math, or similar quantitative field
5+ years of professional experience with machine learning, statistical analysis, predictive modeling, time series analysis, and/or customer segmentation
strong data discovery and analysis skills
experience with big data using technologies like hadoop, spark, nosql and/or traditional relational databases
experience with statistical software packages & tools (scikit learn, scipy, r, matlab, mahout, torch)
experience with a variety of relevant languages (python, java, scala, pig, sql) preferably on linux

 
exceptional candidates will also have the following qualifications:

industry experience with common machine learning models (linear models, svm, random forests naïve bayes, neural nets)
deep learning (tensor flow, keras) is a strong plus
experience with data visualization (ggplot2, d3, tableau)
