job description


cloud computing is revolutionizing it and forcing organizations to rethink their approach to cloud security. lacework is at the forefront of this transformation. we enable security teams to effectively secure public and private clouds – aws, azure or collocations – by eliminating repetitive, manual and labor-intensive security tasks. using lacework, security teams operate security at the same pace as devops, which relies on automated tools to publish daily updates to the cloud.
 
in this position, you’ll actively contribute to building lacework’s user experience and user interface. if you love a start-up environment, are a developer motivated by solving problems efficiently and elegantly; or is good at taking a clever idea from concept to completion, this is the job for you.
 
we are a small and dynamic team – join us and be part of the three fastest growing enterprise software markets: cloud, security, and machine learning.
