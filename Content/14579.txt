software engineer, backend - ads targeting & modeling

san francisco, ca











who we are:
our mission is to enable advertisers to reach hundred millions of twitter users who resonate with their business. â we provide various ad targeting criteria, such as interest, demographics, tailored audiences, etc. we accomplish this by leveraging the latest technologies in big data, machine learning, deep learning, ai, and distributed systems.
what you will do:
you will build twitterâs next-generation tailored audience targeting platform, working closely with product managers, data scientist, and machine learning engineers. tailored audience targeting is one of twitterâs largest revenue generating products. â it is a powerful technology that enables advertisers to reach the audience that will give them the highest return on ad spend.
example of projects you will work on:

build highly performant, scalable, robust distributed systems to enable advertisers to create, update and manage their tailored audiences in real time. you will leverage the latest batch and streaming processing technologies to build and improve the various pipelines to process petabyte scale of data gathered from on and off twitter, such as data generated from web and app activities.

build identity matching graphs to match various identities we support, such as email address, phone number, mobile device ids, website cookie ids, partner cookie ids, etc. identity matching is a core technology we invest to find twitter users to target and to attribute conversions to the ads which users engage on twitter.

build infra and online services to target twitter users based on the tailored audiences or the rules which define tailored audiences. you will work closely with other engineers in sister teams (revenue platform, etc) to design and implement it to decide usersâ eligibilities for ads based on inclusion and/or exclusion targeting criteria advertisers have selected.

â requirements:

m.s. or higher in computer science or other related discipline (or b.s. plus 2 years relevant work experience)

fluent in one or more object oriented languages like java, scala, c#, c++

working knowledge of software engineering best practices (e.g. code reviews, unit testing / integration testing.)

experience with medium to large scale distributed backend systems.

experience with relational and non-relational databases, such as mysql, memcache, redis, etc.
