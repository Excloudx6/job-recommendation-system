description
senior scientist, machine learning and virtual screening
schrödinger, a technology leader specializing in software solutions for life science research and development, is seeking a computational scientist with outstanding skills in empirical scoring function development, parameterization and validation.  the ideal candidate is a scientist experienced in the application, development, and refinement of methods to rapidly predict protein-ligand complex geometries and ligand activities. the candidate should also have a demonstrated ability to adapt modern machine learning methods to virtual screening applications.  the candidate should also work well in a collaborative environment and be eager to adopt good software engineering practices. 
required qualifications include:

ph.d. in computational chemistry, chemical physics, or related fields
unix/linux, fortran/c/c++, and python experience
peer-reviewed publications in computational chemistry and/or chemical physics
experience using modern machine learning methods including random forest, support vector machines, and/or deep learning
experience developing empirical scoring functions for predicting protein-ligand complex geometries and binding affinities
excellent communication skills, both written and verbal

benefits include medical, dental, 401(k), flexible spending account, vacation, tuition reimbursement, and a flexible work schedule.
