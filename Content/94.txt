about murmuration
murmuration seeks massively improved education outcomes for kids by providing information, infrastructure, and support for education-related public advocacy and community building efforts.  
one of mumuration's key initiatives, minsights, is an online platform that allows users to aggregate data from a wide variety of sources such as partner organization’s member data, publicly available data, consumer data, voterfile data, and more. this data can then be used by partners to activate and expand their supporter bases effectively, and mobilize them for sustained political change. we also use this data to build predictive machine learning models that improve our partners’ efficiency. murmuration has the unique opportunity to build, with partners, a massive dataset that can leverage creative data science to profoundly change the way that advocacy efforts and service providers engage their bases.  
about the position
we are looking for an innovative data engineer to maintain and architect the data systems and pipelines to support our efforts. we use a variety of leading database technologies (aws redshift, mongodb) to store our existing data and the data engineer is core to maintaining those resources. the role calls for expertise in managing aws resources and maintaining python data ingestion pipelines. there is also the opportunity to architect new data stores for our ever-growing data needs, and so a creative, problem solving mindset is highly desirable. 
the data team is a highly collaborative, friendly and hard-working group and we are looking for team members that embody those values. the data engineer will report to the director of data. 
the data engineer will: 

build, maintain and enhance a robust data warehouse to centrally hold data from partners, vendors and other data sources. 
develop and deploy aws resources like redshift and rds clusters and ec2 instances to support our work, and manage the security around those resources through aws security groups and vpcs
manage and improve the data ingestion pipelines that service our data warehouse, which are currently built in python. 
collaborate with our data science team to help build out our data analytics automated pipeline in python
architect new database solutions for our growing data needs, in a team that highly values new and innovative technologies as much as tried and trusted solutions
make recommendations and provide strategic support regarding ways to make data and database operations more efficient and effective across murmuration

candidate profile
murmuration attracts employees with distinctive and diverse backgrounds and accomplishments. integrity, creativity, flexibility, and drive are key attributes of competitive candidates. 
the ideal candidate will have: 

msc or higher in computer science or equivalent degree
>1 year experience managing large aws database resources, either rds, redshift or dynamodb, and the setup of vpcs and security groups to manage access to these resources
excellent sql skills, with experience in building and interpreting complex queries 
excellent python programming skills, with a track record of well-designed and maintainable code. you do not have to be a professional programmer but you should be able to demonstrate mastery of how to build a data processing pipeline, that scales and is easily maintained. 
experience in database design and structure, with an emphasis on scalability
a strong desire to develop new and innovative ways to improve our data storage and processing.
