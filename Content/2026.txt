winterwyman software technology search is helping a local product development company scaling their data engineering team. our client provides customized data analytic solutions and their platform allows their customers (healthcare organizations that make sizable investments in purchasing very large data sets for research purposes) to sort, mine, and analyze this data in a much simpler and more dynamic way.
