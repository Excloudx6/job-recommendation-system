who we are:
the ads marketplace team is responsible for placing each and every ad that twitter serves. while placing those ads we decide how best to balance user experience, advertiser results, and twitter revenue. our team optimizes the ad delivery engine, manages demand/supply, and improves product outcomes by applying data science and machine learning skills. we routinely deliver significant improvements to our revenue, and work in a close sync with our executive staff (including our coo & cfo) due to our direct impact on twitterâs business.
