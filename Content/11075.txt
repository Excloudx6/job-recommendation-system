band 04: data scientists develop and apply advanced methods to identify, collect, process, and analyze large volumes of data to build and enhance products, processes, and systems. they plan and lead efforts to conduct advanced data mining and retrieval, and apply statistical and mathematical analyses to identify trends, solve analytical problems, optimize performance, and gather intelligence to accomplish novel or complex assignments. they visualize information using an advanced knowledge of a wide range of tools (e.g., gis, r, or python), develop sophisticated scripts and algorithms, create advanced explanatory and predictive models, and lead comparative analyses to address complex problems.

* apply complex statistical and mathematical analysis to identify trends, conflicts, opportunities, solve complex analytic problems, optimize data interoperability
* lead collaborative efforts to develop and implement new and innovative collection and analytic methods to answer emerging intelligence questions
* visualize information, develops complex scripts and algorithms, create explanatory and predictive models, and conduct comparative and alternative analysis to address complex military and intelligence challenges.

band 05: data scientists oversee and direct the development and application of advanced or innovative methods to identify, collect, process, and analyze large and complex volumes of data to build and enhance products, processes, and systems. they provide expert advice and guidance and lead efforts to conduct data mining and retrieval, and apply statistical and mathematical analyses to identify trends, solve analytical problems, optimize performance, and gather intelligence. they develop new ways to visualize information using extensive knowledge of a wide range of tools (e.g., gis, r, or python), develop and disseminate sophisticated scripts and algorithms, create highly advanced explanatory and predictive models, and oversee comparative analyses to address complex problems.

* explore leading technology and methods to improve predictive modeling capabilities
* lead enterprise-wide initiatives to develop and refine collection and analytic methods to resolve priority intelligence challenges
* provide innovative solutions for highly complex data challenges; work with internal and external stakeholders to identify solutions

 reasonable accommodation policy


                                                federal agencies must provide reasonable accommodation to applicants with disabilities where appropriate. applicants requiring reasonable accommodation for any part of the application and hiring process should contact the hiring agency directly. determinations on requests for reasonable accommodation will be made on a case-by-case basis.
                                            

                                                a reasonable accommodation is any change to a job, the work environment, or the way things are usually done that enables an individual with a disability to apply for a job, perform job duties or receive equal access to job benefits.
                                            

                                                under the rehabilitation act of 1973, federal agencies must provide reasonable accommodations when:

                                                
an applicant with a disability needs an accommodation to have an equal opportunity to apply for a job.
an employee with a disability needs an accommodation to perform the essential job duties or to gain access to the workplace.
an employee with a disability needs an accommodation to receive equal access to benefits, such as details, training, and office-sponsored events.



                                                you can request a reasonable accommodation at any time during the application or hiring process or while on the job. requests are considered on a case-by-case basis.
