job description

	somalogic is a privately-owned biomedical science company that developed a revolutionary proteomics technology capable of measuring thousands of different proteins in a single small sample. we are a dedicated team of scientists, bioinformaticians, statisticians, and software developers working to build new tools based on our technology that will change the way life science research is done and healthcare is delivered. come apply your technical expertise to making healthcare better for your loved ones and the whole world.

	somalogic is seeking a bioinformatics quantitative analyst to work with the clinical and corporate strategy & development teams to identify novel patterns in high dimensional proteomic data, discover proteomic signatures, and apply bioinformatics techniques to elucidate biological functions. this position will focus on the design, execution, and analysis of proof-of-principle studies and validation studies resulting in products, technical material facilitating market and business development activities, and scientific publications.

	this role is an opportunity to work at the forefront of biomarker discovery conducting quantitative statistical analyses of high dimensional data produced by somalogic’s revolutionary proteomic measurement system. a successful candidate will be part of a dynamic, creative and innovative bioinformatics team performing exploratory analyses in key areas to facilitate business growth into new areas.

key job responsibilities:


		perform timely quantitative statistical analyses of high dimensional proteomic data, present findings, and generate written analysis reports

		partner with internal clients to understand requests, propose analytic methods, define deliverables and produce timely analysis results and reports

		develop modular and reusable statistical software tools to perform complex statistical analyses and prepare data displays for internal clients

		work closely with assay development and assay bioinformatics groups to characterize and be able to communicate analytical performance of complex multi-analyte proteomics assay

		keep abreast of new methodologies in high dimensional data analysis through literature review, workshops and professional meetings

		present findings and results to various internal groups



skills & requirements

education

	master’s degree with 12+ years of related experience or ph.d. in statistics/biostatistics, applied mathematics, bioinformatics, or related field

skills and experience
