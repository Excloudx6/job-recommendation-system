requirements

javascript:
                                            
                                                
experience providing solutions based on javascript in the front and back end;
ideal candidate should be familiar with es6, es7, and can describe things like prototypical inheritance, de-structuring, the spread operator, this, and other advanced javascript concepts.


node.js:
                                            
                                                
experience providing back-end solutions with node.js in self-hosted and cloud-hosted environments;
be able to discuss internals of node.js such as the event loop, asynchronous programming, streams, and node ecosystem concerns (i.e. versioning and deployment).


angularjs:
                                            
                                                
ideal candidate has multiple deployed applications using angular technologies and enough time has passed now for avid angular developers to have angular 2.0 applications in production;
extensive development in other web based ui frameworks will work but should be willing to prove they can rapidly adopt work with angular concepts.


restful api:
                                            
                                                
experience in public restful interfaces and can describe the tenets of rest, compare rest to soap, and describe rest best practices.


security:
                                            
                                                
understanding of the tenets of protecting client data in motion and at rest as well as different techniques for authenticating and authorizing clients / consumers of service data.


git:
                                            
                                                
ideal candidate has performed primary product development with git-based source control solutions (github, gitlab, etc.);
understanding of concepts such as rebasing, squashing, cherry picking, and tagging.


nosql / sql:
                                            
                                                
experience working with unix-based sql, nosql databases (mongo, postgresql, oracle, etc.);
understanding of the core concepts of relational databases and nosql databases (querying, indexing, aggregation, etc.);
experience in javascript-based libraries to access nosql / sql databases (mongoose, node orm, sequelize, etc.).


typescript:
                                            
                                                
experience in typescript or a static based language that transpiles to javascript;
our teams use typescript extensively and find that candidates that don't have a lot of typescript benefit from significant static language experience combined with javascript experience.


test automation tools:
                                            
                                                
experience in functional and unit test based frameworks to develop automated tests (mocha, jasmine, cucumber, etc.).


bachelor’s degree in computer science or software engineering, or at least six, typically eight or more years of solid, diverse work experience in internal or external software product development.
