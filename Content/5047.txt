at amd, we push the boundaries of what is possible.  we believe in changing the world for the better by driving innovation in high-performance computing, graphics, and visualization technologies – building blocks for gaming, immersive platforms, and the data center. 
 
developing great technology takes more than talent: it takes amazing people who understand collaboration, respect, and who will go the “extra mile” to achieve unthinkable results.  it takes people who have the passion and desire to disrupt the status quo, push boundaries, deliver innovation, and change the world.   if you have this type of passion, we invite you to take a look at the opportunities available to come join our team.

develop software and systems solutions that address the evolving needs of amd’s customers
drive research and development, proofs of concept, technology transfer, and customer interactions that lead to the development of amd best-in-class machine learning platforms
collaborate with research, engineering, and other amd teams to drive software and systems solutions for machine learning applications.
