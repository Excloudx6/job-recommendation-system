about our engineering team:as a member of foursquare’s engineering team, we want you to bring experience building real products from the ground up. we're passionate about tackling tough challenges in the location space and look for others who like to dive deep into code and help solve hard problems. you should be comfortable running with your own ideas and eager to learn new skills on a bleeding edge platform. we use a variety of tools, technologies, and languages to build software (scala, thrift, mongodb, memcached, es2015+ javascript, react/redux, webpack, closure compiler, pants) but experience with equivalent ones will do just fine.
in the last year, our small team has shipped countless features and improvements in addition to 4 major new products: attribution by foursquare, pilgrim sdk dashboard, foursquare analytics, and an internal research tool. our engineers play a key role in product development, from concept to launch, so be ready to bring your creative ideas to the table as we continue to scale up our saas web products. we push new versions of the website and api almost every day so it won't take long to get your work out in front of our millions of users.
qualifications:


3+ years of proven experience building software for fast growing web or mobile products
solid foundation in computer science fundamentals with sound knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and design
strong javascript skills and experience building highly interactive web apps using modern client-side view frameworks such as react/redux (preferred), angular, or vue.js
experience with java or other object-oriented programming language or, even better, experience and/or interest in functional languages (we use scala!)
experience with restful web services, both writing your own and consuming those written by others
bonus points for experience building interactive data visualizations using libraries like d3, highcharts, and leaflet, and for experience working with big data systems like hive, hadoop, scalding and spark.
comfortable in a small and fast-paced startup environment
bachelor's degree or higher in computer science or related field, or equivalent experience

  because a person may become disabled at any time, we are required to ask all of our

  self-identify as having a disability on this form without fear of any punishment
  because you did not identify as having a disability earlier.
