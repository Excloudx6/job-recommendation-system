  kept private and will not be used against you in any way.

  because a person may become disabled at any time, we are required to ask all of our
  employees to update their information every five years.  you may voluntarily
  self-identify as having a disability on this form without fear of any punishment
  because you did not identify as having a disability earlier.

  documents in an alternate format, using a sign language interpreter, or using
