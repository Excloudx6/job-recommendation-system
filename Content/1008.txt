process engineer entry level
job descriptionintel leads the semiconductor industry by creating innovative technologies. from strained silicon, to high-k metal gate technology, to the world’s first 3-d tri-gate transistor in production on the 22nm process, our process engineers have a passion for leading the industry and changing the world.as an intel process engineer, you’ll join a team helping to develop the most efficient means for semiconductor manufacturing, enabling microprocessors to do more with less – less energy, fewer resources and smaller real estate. process engineers, along with yield and equipment engineers, take responsibility for monitoring and controlling wafer fabrication and product performance; managing tool productivity, maintenance and yields; conducting data analysis to improve processes; and managing quality measurement for 32nm technology and below. together with these engineers, you’ll take a demanding set of functions and turn them into the computing technology that transforms how the world works, plays, learns and communicates. if you are looking for a position where you can see the end results of your work making a real impact on the tech world and on real experiences, this is the team for you.your responsibilities may include:designing and planning the layout for such processes as laminating, etching, plating, roughening, mechanical drilling, laser drilling, photolithography, and other material processing operationsplanning the sequence of operations and specifying procedures for preparing basic materialexercising judgment in compromising between conflicting requirements, economic evaluation of methods, and operator effectiveness and comfortconducting tests and measurements throughout stages of production to determine control over such variables as temperature, density, specific gravity, pressure, and viscosityestablishing and submitting processing requirements to be met in designing and acquiring processing equipmentresponding to customer/client requests or events as they occurdeveloping solutions to problems utilizing formal education and judgmentthis position may require the ability to temporarily relocate to another intel site and/or work a modified shift.an ideal candidate would exhibit behavioral traits that indicate:strong analytical mind with problem solving skillsability to work independently and manage stakeholdersability to deal with ambiguity in defining activities and directionpassion for the jobhigh motivation with a strong work ethicgood planning skillsexcellent written and verbal communication skillsyou must meet the qualifications to be considered for this position. preferred qualifications are in addition to the minimum requirements and are considered a plus factor in identifying top candidates. experience listed below would be obtained through a combination of your school work, class course work, research, relevant previous job and/or internship experiences. upon applying for this opportunity, you will also be considered for other similar opportunities available.qualificationsdegree in materials science, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, optical engineering, chemical engineering, chemistry, applied mechanics, or physics.preferred qualifications:experience with:data analysis (jmp, spc, matlab, mathematica)design of experiment (doe) principlessemiconductor processes (thin films, diffusion, planar, implant, litho, etch, and/or metrology)understanding the relationship between processing versus microstructure versus mechanical and physical properties of materials (polymers, composites, metals, and ceramics)working with fracture and adhesion mechanisms of materials and material interfacesapplying the fundamentals of materials science and engineeringmanaging the metal solidification process and/or phase diagrams, polymerization, deformation of materials, and material developmentcontrolling the semiconductor or packaging process and equipmentinside this business groupintel makes possible the most amazing experiences of the future. you may know us for our processors. but we do so much more. intel invents at the boundaries of technology to make amazing experiences possible for business and society, and for every person on earth. harnessing the capability of the cloud, the ubiquity of the internet of things, the latest advances in memory and programmable solutions, and the promise of always-on 5g connectivity, intel is disrupting industries and solving global challenges. leading on policy, diversity, inclusion, education and sustainability, we create value for our stockholders, customers, and society.other locationsus, arizona, phoenix;
