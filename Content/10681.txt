description


the epa environmental research and business support program has an immediate opening for a part-time (up to 20 hours per week) geospatial measurement data support position with the office of research and development at the epa facility in research triangle park, nc.
the office of research and development at the epa supports high-quality research to improve the scientific basis for decisions on national environmental issues and help epa achieve its environmental goals. research is conducted in a broad range of environmental areas by scientists in epa laboratories and at universities across the country.
the national risk management research laboratory (nrmrl) develops and uses next generation emission measurement (ngem) approaches to help address emerging needs related to fugitive air pollution sources.  the group specializes in measurements in and near industrial facilities and neighboring communities with focus on volatile organic compounds and hazardous air pollutants.  in collaboration with external partners and industry groups, the nrmrl team demonstrates real-world application of ngem systems for source characterization and emissions mitigation.  primary focus:
•        passive and active fenceline monitoring
•        near-facility community impacts
•        epa method otm 33 and related mobile measurements methods
•        next generation leak detection and repair concepts
•        inverse source location and emission estimation approaches
•        hyper spectral imaging and advanced remote sensing research
the selected candidate shall provide data management, data curation and data analysis support for the ngem team.  he/she shall develop original data processing algorithms and statistical regression models to assist in understanding and publishing complex near-source sensor data sets. the position will involve file management, data curation and extraction, quality control, as well as performing qualitative and quantitative data analysis. the selected candidate shall work with other members of nrmrl’s ngem team to maintain multiple datasets for active field efforts, quality control entered data, and perform downstream analysis. he/she shall be a member of a multi-disciplinary research team and shall be trained to support the development, maintenance, and analysis of emerging ngem systems.
