about us

                authentic8 is a company born from another.
            


                postini pioneered the idea that a cloud service
                could solve the problems with email, and back in 1999 this was heresy.
                but, we broke new ground and built a service that our customers loved and google coveted. authentic8 is a very different idea, but the parallels with postini are many. we are addressing a real problem, we have a novel approach, and we thrive on delighting customers.
            
                our thesis is simple. as business apps move to the cloud, the browser is more important than ever. yet it's an unmanageable resource, especially as users login from anywhere and any device. we think its a problem worth solving, but it requires a radical shift in thinking. so we came up with silo.
            
                as a team we are direct and pragmatic. our culture is pretty straightforward. we actively manage a no ***hole policy and we grade ourselves on two dimensions: doing things right and doing the right things.
            
                learn more about us in the people section, or drop us a line. we'd love to hear from you.

our people

                the team is a good mix of experience and youth. there are 
                offices in mountain view and san francisco, and people are free
                to roam between them. everyone gets together in mountain view
                at least one day a week, and the rest of the time we use google
                hangouts to keep in touch.
