work with cutting-edge compiler technologies
optimize the entire deep learning pipeline
apply your knowledge of software engineering best practices

requirements:

ability to work independently, define project goals and scope, and lead your own development effort.
excellent c/c++ programming and software design skills, including debugging, performance analysis, and test design.
