perception engineer - (computer vision / machine learning) - lvl5, inc.perception engineer - (computer vision / machine learning)computer visionsan francisco, ca, united stateswhat we're buildinglvl5 builds hd maps for self-driving cars using computer vision. our iphone app, payver, (http://www.getpayver.com) has thousands of drivers, sending us terabytes of driving data each day.we receive video and other telemetry measurements from our fleet, and run advanced computer vision algorithms on the data to map the roads with high precision -- down to just a few centimeters. unlike traditional maps, hd maps contain all the nitty-gritty details of the road, such as where the car should look for traffic lights, and how to turn through a complex intersection.we work directly with automakers, and also with tier 1 manufacturers to provide intelligent driver assist products as well as full localization capabilities for a "level 5" self-driving vehicle.responsibilities:work with structure from motion to extract depth data from sequential imagesimprove our deep-learning-based image segmentation and object detection pipelinesdevelop map reconstruction algorithms with an emphasis on 3d reconstruction using cameras, gnss, and imurequirements:5+ years experience with python or c++bachelor degree in computer science/engineering, or equivalent real-world experiencepassionate about self-driving technology and its potential impact on the worldattention to detail and a passion for qualitybonus points:experience with ros or another robotics frameworkexperience with nvidia px platformyou have designed and trained models for various aspects of autonomous driving such as perceptionyou have optimized code for deployment on mobile/embedded devicesyou are an excellent leader and mentor. you have the presence and poise to grow and manage a team.Â robotics / autonomy backgroundperks:health, dental, and vision coverage$5k budget to spend on your developer workstationfree snacks, coffee, and drinksflexible work hoursfun offsitesremind me to apply laterclearwant to apply later?type your email address below to receive a reminderemailerrorrequired fieldcancelsend reminderapply to jobfirst nameerrorrequired fieldlast nameerrorrequired fieldemailerrorrequired fieldphone numbererrorwebsiteerrorresumeattachattachclearinsert_drive_filedeletecover letterattachattachclearinsert_drive_filedeletesubmitprivacy.terms
