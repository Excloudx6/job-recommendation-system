for the past two years or more, you've described yourself as an object-oriented php developer, and have experience coding and maintaining web applications, in zend, sympfony, or magento.
you have a portfolio of php sites and modules to display your downright wizardry with the platform.
you git what i'm saying.
you’ve worked on the same project long enough that you’re disappointed with a feature or module you built months ago (and you can build it better now).
you're proficient in sql database management, javascript (jquery, prototype), and lamp stack development environments.
