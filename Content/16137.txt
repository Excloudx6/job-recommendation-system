job description


revolutionparts is looking for a talented engineer to help evolve our technology to support our next phase of growth. you'll be joining a team of professionals that are dedicated to providing cutting edge e-commerce solutions to the auto parts industry.  
if you want a clear-cut role with the same tasks for years, this is not for you. if you like to think big and work on a variety of projects, we need you! here's a sample of project descriptions:
- we have 50 million parts in a db. create a technology stack that can support real-time dynamic search of these parts (google style) -- think "2010 accord water pump".
keywords: elasticsearch, node.js, parallel processing
- we have a history of 700,000+ orders. create a recommendation engine that will suggest other parts along with what a buyer already has in their cart. oh -- and the recommended part has to fit the same car. return the result in 100 ms or less.
keywords: we're not sure, research technologies that might help accomplish this.
- create a clean public rest api for parts dealers to import orders that they get from sources other than our stores.
keywords: authentication, json, good api design.
- create an internal shopping cart service that can manage millions of carts a month.
keywords: memcached/redis, nosql, scaling, availability
- we need to spin up 50 servers on aws to crunch some numbers every month. let's automate that.
requirements: 
- bachelor and/or masters in computer science or computer engineering
- you have some experience - but most of all you are hungry for new challenges
- a solid understanding of oo design and all computer science fundamentals
- must like the dynamic and fast-paced nature of a smaller team working in a company doubling in size each year
- gsd - get stuff done
skills: 
- design of apis (internal or external)
- design of high-availability-self-healing systems
- design of scalable systems
- understanding of databases, relational or not. sql.
- architecture decision making - real-time, batch, queue-based processing?
- scripting languages (we do a lot of coding in php)
benefits: 
- top salary, stock options, and relocation assistance
- retirement plan
- medical and dental insurance
- flexible hours
- casual dress code
- free lunch friday
- fully stocked fridge and snacks
- team happy hours
