job summary

we are seeking a motivated and talented engineer to explore efficient implementation of deep learning algorithms and applications on to embedded computing platforms like fpgas.

responsibilities
mapping deep learning networks on to embedded platforms with limited compute/memory/power constraints is a challenging problem. you will design and architect fpga prototypes for efficient high-performance and low-power implementations of these algorithms. you will also develop tools and algorithms to automatically generate hdl code for a generic deep learning network specification. you are expected to participate in all aspects of software development with enthusiasm: collecting requirements, writing specifications, coding and testing.

minimum qualifications
candidates must be pursuing a master's level or a phd level degree in a technical discipline.
experience with matlab
experience with fpga's

additional qualifications

at least 2 years of practical hdl design/coding experience.
mature understanding of deep learning networks like convolutional neural networks (cnns) and recurrent neural networks (rnns). experience in deploying them to gpus/fpgas is a plus.


knowledge about modern compiler technologies is a plus.
knowledge of c/c++ is a plus.
strong abstraction and algorithmic skills.


good understanding of object-oriented design principles.


strong communication skills.
