job description
req id: 5361
shift: days
employment status: af - active - regular - full time 
job summary the bioinformatics scientist ii will apply knowledge of bioinformatics algorithms and analysis platforms to consult with investigators on their projects and to serve as a collaborative investigator in academic output including assistance in experimental design and writing, including creation of scientifically rigorous visualizations, communications, and presentations of results. the scientist will be working with a diverse, highly skilled, team-oriented  laboratory and clinical oncology team in the maris lab at chop.  the candidate will process sequencing data both in local clusters as well as through cloud services. candidates must be able to show proficiency in development of analysis systems, such as pipelines and automation for analysis of high-throughput data. candidates will have an excellent understanding of the strengths and limitations of commonly used data generating platforms as they apply to experimental endpoints and will readily be able to set expectations and defend results through frequent and direct communication with collaborators.
job responsibilities pre-analysis (20%): contribute to the development of application portfolio by developing knowledge of internally developed systems, open-source programs, and commercial applications. provide efficient data management support.

use standard pipelines for data processing and manipulation in advance of performing analysis in a manner that best enables the analysis plan
contribute to the development of additional pipeline functionality and changes by providing knowledge of both collaboration-specific requirements and bioinformatics discipline advances
advocate for specific collaboration requirements for continual advancement of  shared pipeline and code resources
provide collaboration-specific transparency for data processing and pre-analysis, including sample- and cohort-level status

coding (20%): code and generally support code and applications on behalf of collaborative project and/or team.

within the context of the collaboration or project, develop and apply best practices to code development:
	
establish requirements with the project team
review existing applications and code sources (both commercial and open source) and selection of best strategy for development or adoption
advocate for chosen strategy to project team by showing value of approach


develop best practices for project-based code development, qc, and execution consist with the expectations of specific collaborations
regularly seek peer-to-peer code reviews by participating in informal and formal critical code reviews

data analysis (20%): analyze data of high complexity by applying sound statistical and commonly accepted bioinformatics methods to -omics data primarily under the direction of the collaborative project team

develop robust analysis plans independently with regular peer-to-peer review in both informal and formal settings
incorporate more advanced applications and methods into analysis
develop at least one “specialty” analytical or biomedical area that serves the collaborative team

collaboration (20%): establish role within collaborative project team as primary bioinformatics resource

contribute to and influence project-level management by serving as bioinformatics point
define and promote boundaries of support by assessing all stakeholders, including bioinformatics management, collaborator expectations, and funding levels and mechanisms
regularly discuss satisfaction and expectations with collaborators; continually advocate for clear understanding of role
develop new collaborations with high degree of supervision

academic output (20%): develop presentations, grant sections, and manuscript sections with subsequent review by peers and mentors.

regularly contribute to bioinformatics-focused manuscripts and publications
regularly contribute to podium presentations and posters
contribute to bioinformatics sections of grant and award proposals
