software engineer

        at catalant
      

        boston
      


catalant is looking for pragmatic engineers.  our team is responsible for creating and supporting a marketplace that connects over 40,000 independent experts with global businesses.  we try not to overbuild:  we value shipped code over perfect code.  there are no ivory towers here.  easy things should be easy.  time to market is important, as is time to fix.  we value honesty, teamwork and cooperation.  sound good?  
 
based in boston’s seaport, catalant serves thousands of enterprise clients, including ge, pfizer and staples, as well as countless others on a confidential basis.  our investors include highland capital, greylock partners, and general catalyst, three of the top venture capital firms out there, as well as famed investor mark cuban (yup, the one from shark tank!). we're on a mission to build the absolute best team on the east coast, and we’re looking for talented, scrappy, and fun folks to get on board.
 
we’re a python shop on the flask framework.  we use docker.  we do continuous deployment. we work in 4-6 person scrum teams, writing new features and customized business logic for our clients.  we limit meetings, so you’re focused on the stuff that matters.  if you get stuck on a problem you’re working on, your team is right there to help you out and get you moving again. our brand-new office has plenty of space to explore.  feel like you need a change of perspective?  go work in our garden, or the cafe or the library.  
 
if you are a motivated developer with 1-4 years of programming background and an interest to work in a fun, fast paced environment then look no further.  catalant needs engineers like you to power this rocket ship.

  military, ground, naval, or air service.

  measure how well we are doing, we are asking you to tell us if you have a disability or
  if you ever had a disability.  completing this form is voluntary, but we hope that you

  kept private and will not be used against you in any way.


  if you already work for us, your answer will not be used against you in any way.
  because a person may become disabled at any time, we are required to ask all of our
  employees to update their information every five years.  you may voluntarily
  self-identify as having a disability on this form without fear of any punishment
  because you did not identify as having a disability earlier.

  history or record of such an impairment or medical condition.

  documents in an alternate format, using a sign language interpreter, or using
