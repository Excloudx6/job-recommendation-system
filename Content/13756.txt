        chicago
      


hatch loyalty is looking for great software developers.
our team is experienced, principled, and multi-dimensional. we maintain a full, modern service stack that includes infrastructure layer, soa application architecture, and browser/client-facing applications. we use ruby today on the back end, and our front-end stack includes react and typescript. we've found these technologies great to work in but we don't ignore that there may be better tools ahead.
we're building a platform to compete in the customer loyalty industry by focusing on tools and integrations that enable meaningful customer relationships. our apis and applications are driving the next generation of the personalized loyalty experience. as a team we're passionate about owning the development of our products from commit to customer, and seek candidates who feel similarly.
we prefer some commercial experience in current web applications development practices -- though we're really interested in candidates who are curious, fun to work with, and have a history of learning and adapting quickly.
