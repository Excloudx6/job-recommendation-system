  military, ground, naval, or air service.


  an "active duty wartime or campaign badge veteran" means a veteran who served on active

  kept private and will not be used against you in any way.

  because a person may become disabled at any time, we are required to ask all of our
  employees to update their information every five years.  you may voluntarily
  self-identify as having a disability on this form without fear of any punishment
  because you did not identify as having a disability earlier.
